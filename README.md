## Overview

This repository houses my completed work for the British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship. The internship provided an incredible opportunity to immerse myself in the world of data analysis within the aviation industry. By applying web scraping techniques and predictive modeling, I gained valuable insights into customer feedback, sentiments, and predictive trends.

## Tasks and Achievements

### Task 1: Uncovering Customer Insights Through Web Scraping

In Task 1, I delved into the art of web scraping by gathering customer feedback and review data from [Skytrax](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NjynCWzGSaWXQCxSX/Data-Science). Through comprehensive analysis, I unearthed valuable insights that enhanced my understanding of customer sentiments, preferences, and needs. By analyzing this treasure trove of data, I gained a deeper perspective on how customer experiences can shape business success.

### Task 2: Crafting Predictive Excellence with RandomForest Classifier

Task 2 presented an exciting challenge where I harnessed the power of predictive modeling. Armed with my skills, I built a high-quality RandomForest Classifier model that predicted customer bookings with an impressive accuracy rate of 86%. This predictive prowess is a testament to the potential of understanding customer behavior and making informed decisions. By being proactive and predictive, British Airways can redefine success within the aviation industry.
